# Proptech Analysis: San Francisco Real Estate
This project aims to analyze the real-estate market in San Francisco using data visualization techniques. The goal is to identify viable investment opportunities as a proptech company that offers an instant, one-click service for buying and renting properties.

## About
PropTech is a domain in the FinTech industry that applies technologies to real-estate markets. In this project, data from the San Francisco real-estate market will be used as a trial. This project will make use of the hvPlot and GeoViews packages in Python to create visualizations. By applying data visualization techniques, it is possible to uncover valuable insights about the market and discover potential investment opportunities. This could become a valuable tool that simplifies and streamlines the process of buying real-estate and renting properties.
